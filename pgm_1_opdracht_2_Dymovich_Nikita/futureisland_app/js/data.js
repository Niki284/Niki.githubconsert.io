        synopsis: "Brandon Flowers (vocals/keyboards), Ronnie Vannucci (drums), Dave Keuning (guitar) and Mark Stoermer (bass) have been performing together as The Killers since 2002. The Las Vegas quartet have been in the international spotlight ever since their early days. Their 2004 debut, “Hot Fuss”, is considered one of the greatest albums of the 21st century. As of April 2021, “Mr. Brightside”, their first single, had spent 260 weeks in the UK top 100. The Killers have sold more than 25 million albums to date. Awards and nominations for the main music prizes follow the release of each album as a matter of course. Among their biggest hits are “Somebody Told Me”, “When You Were Young”, “Read My Mind”, “Human”, “Run For Cover” and, more recently, “Dustland”. The Killers are a band that have always had a taste for adventure. Their latest album is called “Pressure Machine” (2021), a concept album based on Brandon Flowers’ childhood. It’s their seventh consecutive number one album in the UK – another record.",

        name: "Faith No More",
        synopsis: "Faith No More have always gone against the flow. The Americans do so with humour, a healthy sense of perspective, and a strong faith in their own talent.  This is not just an exceptional band; they are also of great historical importance. In the 1980s, they were the first to blend metal with funk and hip-hop as the founders of what became known as ‘crossover’. Hits like ‘We Care A Lot’ and ‘Epic’ paved the way for Nirvana, while they also inspired Korn and Limp Bizkit. These musical mavericks next shocked friend and foe alike with a smooth cover of ‘Easy’, the Commodores’ soul classic. This in turn made an impression on bands like System Of A Down and Deftones. The watchword is freedom, the outcome is modern metal. Following five years of inactivity, the San Francisco quintet is once again heading out on a world tour.",

        name: "Twenty One Pilots",
        synopsis: "Twenty One Pilots are among the greatest success stories of the 21st century. The numbers don’t lie. Their breakthrough, ‘Blurryface’ (2015), was the first album of the digital era on which all the songs have gone at least gold in the United States. The single ‘Stressed Out’ made the duo the first rock act to achieve more than a billion streams on Spotify. Drummer Josh Dun and keyboard wizard Tyler Joseph are born entertainers. On stage, this means fancy dress, a burning car and backflips off the piano.  Anything goes. Twenty One Pilots appeared at Werchter for the first time in 2014, early in the day in KluB C. They return as an undisputed top act, bringing the recently-released ‘Scaled and Icy’ with them.",

        name: "Red Hot Chili Peppers",
        synopsis: "Red Hot Chili Peppers are their own musical planet. The Californians introduced their original hybrid of rock and funk in the 1980s. Their danceable, distinctive and deeply energetic sound have provided a soundtrack that several generations have grown up to. The four-piece reached maturity with the album ‘Blood Sugar Sex Magik’ in 1991 – 30 years ago this year. ‘Give It Away’ and ‘Under The Bridge’ brought them their first taste of global fame, but it was ‘Californication’ (1999) – with ‘Scar Tissue’ and ‘Otherside’ - and ‘By the Way’ (2002) that really took the band to the top. The band have more than left their mark every time they’ve graced the Werchter stage, like when bassist Flea played in the nude in 1996. The group will be at its strongest in 2022, with star guitarist John Frusciante back on board.",
